**Challenge Description:**
    Author: @JohnHammond#6971

    From the intelligence we have received from our connections, we have heard word that "Dylan Lincoln" is up to no good. 
    He must be hiding something, we are confident he is lying through his teeth! 

**Challenge Solution:**
    This challenge was an interesting one...

    Researching for "Dylan Lincoln" (in quotes) in Google lead to a lot of results - there is an Actor from London called Dylan Lincoln.
    Therefore this did not seem to be the correct path...

    Reading the challenge descirption carefully, the word 'connections', stood out making us think of LINKEDIN...
    A google search of 'site:linkedin.com "Dylan Lincoln"' gave some results to trawl through.

    After a while, images from the same search were looked at, and one stood out as Google told us it was 'From 3 days ago'. 
    This profile picture also had some strange white text in the bottom right... THE FLAG!
